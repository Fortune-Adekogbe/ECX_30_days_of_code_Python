# ECX Python Challenge
The Engineering Career Expo (ECX) is a Univeraity of Lagos Student Organisation that aims to teach other students useful skills. The avaliable tracks are the Python, Backend(node.js), Frontend( html, css and javascript), Mobile development, UI/UX and Engineering design tracks. Due to thw widespread COVID19 pandemic, a 30 days of code and design challenge was created to ensure that students keep learning during this period. In this repo, I have my codes from day 0 to day 29.
